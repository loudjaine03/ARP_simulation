# ARP Protocol Simulation

This project presents a study and simulation of the **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**, focusing on both **Standard ARP** and **Proxy ARP**.  
The goal is to illustrate ARPâ€™s role in mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses and to evaluate its performance through simulated network scenarios.

The simulation was carried out using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and the report includes real-time scenario results.

This project was submitted as part of the Computer Security module for a BSc in Computer Systems at University Dr. Yahia Fares of Medea.
